			<h1>Document non-existent</h1>
			<p>This is a brief hiccup in the course of your internet surfing safari.</p>
			<p>I'll provide an explanation and a <a href="/">valid alternative</a>.</p>

			<h2>Explanation</h2>
			<p>Accessing internet documents requires a correct URL in order to accurately retrieve the desired document. You may have arrived here for one of many reasons. <span class="self">Let's explore those.</span></p>
			<ol>
				<li>You entered the name of a document on baer.works (the host computer of this error page) and it simply doesn't exist. This is an odd phenomenon we'll explore below.</li>
				<li>You clicked a link leading to the baer.works server, which (regardless of its validity at any point in time) is not currently valid.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>A missing page</h2>
			<p>Not unlike paper documents, this web site contains visually digestible information on a 2-dimensional plane &mdash; multiple planes, actually, like pages in a book. But these pages reference each other, similar to the way <em><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195019199/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0195019199&linkCode=as2&tag=baerworks-20&linkId=NJHSDEAMXKVCUODK">A Pattern Language</a></em> does. By this analogy, you've just encountered what would be a page someone ripped out, or a false reference to this non-existent page you currently find yourself on.</p>
			<p>What does one do in such a situation? You can just order another mass-produced book, but this unique page you seek has no copies. You are overcome with a feeling of loss, left pondering what once existed here &mdash; unless, of course, you could rejoice in the abundance you otherwise have. After all, you're reading the words of some guy who lives in another part of the globe. You're reading these words that were transmitted through light or air and converted into pretty letters on your screen. Some might say, <em>Who the hell cares about a little 404?</em> There are many awe-inspiring things in the world &mdash; even your ability to understand these glyphs forming words representing signs forming sentences forming abstract ideas &mdash; that make the little soul-shaking moments like this seem utterly insignificant.</p>
			<p>You will make it past this moment, as you or I undoubtedly have many times before. But not before a final digression...</p>

			<h2>Shifting validity</h2>
			<p>On the aforementioned <em>validity</em> of your entered URL:</p>
			<p>It is as if you are walking along a trail in the woods. A man in the town you just departed mentioned a fork you'd see about 1,000 paces in, and that the left-most path would hold your desired route. But that man hadn't been in the woods for at least a year, and unbeknownst to him, the left-most path has swiftly grown over with brush and grass (especially with the recent proliferation of hyper-realistic virtual reality).</p>
			<p>Thus there is no longer a fork, and your path continues gently to the right of where there once was a choice to be made; and soon you will find yourself here: lost, in a place far from your desired path that is no longer of this world.</p>
