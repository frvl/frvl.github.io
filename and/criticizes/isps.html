			<h1><abbr title="Internet Service Providers">ISPs</abbr> are holding the web hostage</h1>

			<p><em>December 2, 2017</em>. Since we're probably about to lose net neutrality with the FCC's vote on the 14th, here's a wealth of evidence as to why we need strong Title II enforcement to keep our beloved, "neutral" internet.</p>
			<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: ISPs have <a href="https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history">incessantly proven</a> they will do anything in the book to get more money from our pockets and engage in anti-competitive behavior while providing only a minimally-sufficient service (and duh, there's nothing we can do about it).</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.cadc.uscourts.gov/internet/opinions.nsf/EA10373FA9C20DEA85257807005BD63F/$file/08-1291-1238302.pdf">Comcast v. FCC</a> <span class="reading-date">Apr. 6, '10</span> &mdash; In short, the non-Title II authority of the FCC is insufficient to police bad actions of ISPs like Comcast acting against net neutrality. But, Title II would allow the FCC to protect net neutrality.</li>
				<li><a href="https://consumerist.com/2007/10/26/comcasts-we-dont-throttle-bittorrent-internal-talking-points-memo/">Comcast's "We Don't Throttle BitTorrent" Internal Talking Points Memo</a> <span class="reading-date">Oct. 26, '07</span> &mdash; Comcast was messing with BitTorrent traffic. These were the lies they made CS reps tell customers (or risk losing their job).</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/eff-tests-agree-ap-comcast-forging-packets-to-interfere">Comcast is forging packets to interfere with user traffic</a> <span class="reading-date">Oct. 19, '07</span> &mdash; EFF confirms Comcast is messing with filesharing traffic.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Then there are the other ways <a href="http://www.nothypothetical.net/">ISPs have been harmful to consumers</a>. Here's <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-breaks-with-50-years-of-history/">How the FCC's Net Neutrality Plan Breaks With 50 Years of History</a>.</p>
